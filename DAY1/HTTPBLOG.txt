Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1, a widely used protocol, processes requests sequentially, limiting performance due to its text-based nature and
lack of multiplexing. HTTP/2, a binary protocol, introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be
processed in parallel over a single connection. It compresses headers, reducing overhead, and supports server push, 
improving load times by sending assets preemptively. These enhancements lead to faster page loads, reduced latency, 
and more efficient use of network resources compared to HTTP/1.1. Overall, HTTP/2 significantly improves web performance 
and is designed to better handle the demands of modern web applications and content-rich websites.
