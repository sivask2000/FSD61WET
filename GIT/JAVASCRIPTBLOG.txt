Blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

In JavaScript, objects are fundamental data structures used to store collections of key-value pairs. 
Internally, they are represented as dictionaries, where each property name (key) is hashed for quick lookup. 
Values can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, or primitives. Objects can dynamically add or
remove properties, making them versatile for data manipulation and structuring. Memory management is handled automatically 
through garbage collection. Understanding how objects are internally represented helps developers optimize performance and 
design efficient data structures in JavaScript applications, enhancing overall functionality and scalability.
